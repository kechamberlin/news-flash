# **NewsFlash**

## **About**

This project is a static, responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) built using create-react-app.<br /><br />
As one who reads the news several times a day and likes to stay informed, I decided to make my own news website. For inspiration, I used the BBC, Yahoo!, and The New York Times as my models.

## **How It Works**

The user may simply scroll down the page or click one of the navigation links to explore.<br/>

The website has many different news sections:

- Jumbotron with the latest breaking story and the top 10 most-read articles of the last 24 hours.
- US
- World
- Politics
- Business
- Science and Tech
- Opinion

Each section displays the "Top Stories" for each category according to the New York Times.

## **Languages and Technologies Used**

This project features extensive use the following technologies:

- React with Hooks and Functional Components
- React-Scroll
- JSX
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- New York Times API (more APIs to come!)

## **Goals**

In order to make it feel more like a real news website, I want to incorporate the following:

- A weather component that tracks a user's location and displays the appropriate weather.
- A live stock ticker.
- Current Covid-19 information, including case and death tolls.
- 2020 Election-related data, like current Presidential approval rating, Biden v. Trump probablilities, etc.
